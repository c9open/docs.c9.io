# Cloud9 IDE User Documentation

Welcome to the official Cloud9 IDE documentation! Here, you'll find articles and tutorials to help you use the Cloud9 platform. These include everything from setting up a workspace, to learning how to run, debug, and deploy your code.

<!--Don't forget to check out [our YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/c9ide/videos?flow=grid&view=1) which contains videos describing many of the features of the IDE, as well as providing additional tutorials. Our videos are also available on relevant documentation pages.-->
